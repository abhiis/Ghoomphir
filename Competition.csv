We offer two exquisite A-frame cottages, each featuring a duplex setup that can comfortably accommodate up to four guests at standard occupancy and up to six at most.

The other A-frame cottage features a stunning cedar tree gracefully extending through the balcony, providing a truly unique connection with nature. The highlight of both cottages is the breathtaking view they offer. Each cottage provides guests with panoramic vistas of the Jibhi Valley, the majestic Lambhri Peak, and the iconic Jalori Pass, making it an ideal getaway for nature enthusiasts and adventure seekers.

We look forward to hosting you and sharing the natural wonders of this stunning location.As your host, I bring a unique blend of passion and experiences to ensure your stay is both enjoyable and memorable. When I'm not hosting guests, I channel my enthusiasm into my role as a dedicated farmer and horticulturist. I am the proud owner of an apple orchard, where I cultivate and nurture these exquisite fruits, known for their quality and flavour. My love for the land extends beyond just farming. I'm also an avid experimenter, always seeking innovative ways to improve the orchard and contribute to the art of horticulture. These experiments not only allow me to stay in touch with the land but also foster a deep appreciation for the natural world. Beyond my agricultural pursuits, I'm a part-time traveler. Exploring new destinations and cultures is a source of inspiration for me. My travels have broadened my horizons and deepened my understanding of hospitality, making me even more dedicated to providing you with a wonderful and enriching experience during your stay.Our property is situated in a serene and picturesque small village, with a population of approximately 50 people. The village exudes tranquility, offering an escape from the hustle and bustle of urban life. Here, you can immerse yourself in the peaceful ambiance of a close-knit community, where time seems to slow down. One of the key highlights of the village is the beautiful temple dedicated to Goddess Durga. This sacred place holds significant cultural and spiritual importance for both the villagers and visitors. It's an ideal spot to experience the local traditions and connect with the spiritual essence of the region.Languages spoken: English,HindiArea infoSee availabilityAmenities of winterfell treehouse jibhiSee availabilityMost popular amenitiesFree WiFi Free parking Room service Family rooms Breakfast ParkingFree private parking is available on site (reservation is not needed).Accessible parking InternetWiFi is available in all areas and is free of charge.KitchenShared kitchen Cleaning products Kitchen BedroomWalk-in closet BathroomPrivate Bathroom Living AreaSofa Sitting area Room AmenitiesSofa bed Clothes rack Tile/Marble floor Private entrance Interconnecting room(s) available Fan Ironing facilities Iron PetsPets are allowed on request.

The entire structure,excluding the kitchen and bathroom,is a true earthen building crafted from natural materials sourced locally. It is a fusion of traditional Himachali Kathkuni and Nordic architecture,that mirrors our influences & aspirations. This cottage is built by a close-knit group of school-time friends who fell in love with the mountains and the Himalayan Odyssey. Constructing an earthen cottage in this remote location, without direct road access, posed significant challenges. everything single thing that you can see in the cottage including the stones and wood has been physically carried down to this spot. a lot of people including dear villagers, ourselves, and our friends who visited us, have worked very hard, labored harder, and selflessly contributed whatever they could to make it possible to bring this dream to life over two and a half years. as you explore the property you shall find a lot of imperfections in the cottage they are not flaws and they are left deliberately by us to symbolize the authenticity and the work we have put into it and reflect how hard we tried. Our main purpose is to give you all an unparalleled experience of staying at a place and a home like this. we hope you all embrace the cottage in the way it is meant to be and love it. This cottage is the right place for you if... You love to be amongst nature, wilderness and love exploring..You enjoy being outdoors, seek adventure and the tranquility of rural life.You want to experience slow and conscious living.You want to spend some peaceful time in the lap of the mountains.

The atmosphere exudes a vintage rural charm, enveloping us in the warmth of a close-knit community. Being rooted in the heart of India's mountainous region, this village is still unexplored and untouched by mainstream tourism. Their lives are intertwined with the natural rhythms of the land, with days stretching out in a leisurely and unhurried manner. The pace of life here is refreshingly slow, allowing us to appreciate the simple pleasures and savor the moments of tranquility that abound in this idyllic setting. *Getting around* Although the distance is less (around 9-10km). It takes around 45min to 1hr from Jibhi main town to reach our property. It involves a 30min drive on 'Jibhi to Bahu Road' and then 15 minutes off-roading from a point called 'zero point' ( just 2km before reaching bahu), followed by a 15 to 20-minute trek through the village and forest. The trek down to the cottage introduces you to the traditional Himachali village ambiance, offering glimpses of local livelihoods and encounters with rare wild birds and flora.Languages spoken: English,HindiArea infoSee availabilityAmenities of The Pahadi Earthen home JIBHISee availabilityMost popular amenitiesFree parking ParkingFree public parking is available at a location nearby (reservation is not needed).InternetNo internet access available.KitchenStovetop Kitchen BathroomBathtub or shower Private Bathroom Living AreaSitting area Desk Room AmenitiesClothes rack Private entrance PetsPets are allowed.

It is a cozy stay in the middle of Cedar Forest all around and Pushp bhadra River flowing in front of the house.I am a mountaineer and an entrepreneur who has left his city life behind to live a mountain life. I am an expedition leader and an explorer too, so you have got a chance to experience wilderness along your stay.The Misty Wilds Home resides in an off-beat location called Hirab near Jibhi and it is well connected by road. It is a small and cozy village in the middle of Cedar Forest at an altitude of 7500 ft. above sea level, so the place gets plenty of snow in winter.Languages spoken: English,HindiArea infoSee availabilityAmenities of The Misty Wilds Home, JibhiGreat facilities!
